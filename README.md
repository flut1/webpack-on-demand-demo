# webpack-on-demand-demo
Minimal demo for webpack-on-demand module

See: https://github.com/flut1/webpack-on-demand

## Instructions
As webpack-on-demand is intended for usage during development, it only
makes sense to run this demo with webpack-dev-server.

 - clone this repository
 - run `yarn` or `npm install`
 - run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
 - open `localhost:3000` and click the buttons

Note: the bottom button is supposed to error.
